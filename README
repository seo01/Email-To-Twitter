PHP Email to Twitter

=== Intro ===
This is a simple PHP application that runs on your home PC and publishes all e-mails sent to a given e-mail address to a twitter account.

=== The Future ===
It would be very cool if someone could turn this into a web service.

=== Mac OS X -- mac ports ===
The easiest way to get the Imap library to work under OS X requires Mac Ports:
Install from here:
http://www.macports.org/install.php

Sync
>sudo port selfupdate

Install the required libraries (may take sometime):
>sudo port install php5-imap
>sudo port install php5-curl

=== Config ===
All configuration is done with the /src/config.php file. All the config variables are documented in the example config.

=== Modules ===
Email to twitter is highly modula. All the modules are setup in the main src/EmailToTwitter.php files. This is the place to swap out or replace modules.

=== Run ===
You can run EmailToTwitter from the command line:
>php src/EmailToTwitter.php

=== Testing ===
Testing requires installing phpunit. Once this is installed you can simply run
>phpunit src

=== Cron ===
To constantly copy e-mails from your e-mail account to your twitter account you need to add a line to your crontab. Explained below:
If your using mac ports you will need to specify the appropritate PHP version
Add the following line to your cron tab (>crontab -e)
